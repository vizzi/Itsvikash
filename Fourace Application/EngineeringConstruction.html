                    <p>The ongoing massive urbanization and infrastructure expansion in emerging markets has fuelled the growth in demand for raw materials and energy over last decade. Although the continuity in growth for Engineering & Construction industry has been interrupted due to recent uncertainties in global economic climate, the long-term demand outlook in emerging markets is expected to drive significant growth in Capital Spending Trends. Also, the expected resurgence of manufacturing industry in USA led by large scale shale gas discoveries and lower energy prices will fuel the demand for capital infrastructure in coming decade.</p>
                    <p>Engineering & Construction industry is currently faced with increasingly large and complex projects, shorter turnaround times and rich digital handover requirements. Over and above, the increased competition and volatility in material prices has forced the margin constrained Engineering & Construction industry to look at technology as an enabler to bring efficiencies and meet customers’ expectations.</p>
